# Another Recon Script

Use this to run basic recon, this script is intended specifically to test for XSS vulnerabilities and identify components of websites where vulnerabilities could exist.

Use the runRecon.sh script to run everthing- this requires having certain tools pre-installed:
  * Sublist3r
  * httprobe
  * dirsearch
  * Arjun
  * Aquatone
  * ffuf
  * XSStrike

## Usage and Initial setup
You can use config.sh to control the program and set file directories for individual components and where to store outputs.
When you first download you'll need to make executable runRecon.sh (chmod +x ./runRecon.sh)
Plug in your api key for built with in the config.sh file if you want to use that module, turn off otherwise
If you find this useful, and want to modify- feel free, I think I set the code up in a fairly modulary way so you could add other domain enumerations, or testing as needed.
